# Smartphone Data Analysis 📱

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world smartphone dataset using Python and Pandas.  
The primary objective is to transform raw, inconsistent data into a structured and analysis-ready format that can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA and business insights.

## Project Objective
To perform systematic data cleaning on a raw smartphone dataset by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues, ensuring the dataset is reliable and suitable for further analytical tasks.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to smartphones, including:
- Brand and model details
- Hardware specifications
- Pricing information

The original data was noisy and contained missing values, inconsistent formats, and redundant information, which required preprocessing before analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## Data Cleaning Process
The following steps were performed during data preparation:
- Removed irrelevant and redundant rows
- Handled missing and null values using appropriate strategies
- Standardized textual data for consistency
- Converted columns to correct data types
- Ensured the dataset is ready for exploratory analysis
